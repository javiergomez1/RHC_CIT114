As of the release of the video "Inside a Google Data Center" on December 16, 2017, Google went past the three million man-hour mark for zero lost-time incidents.  That is really impressive and amazing.
I like how the data center is described as a node in a larger network of data centers around the world. I usually refer to nodes as network components within an office, such as printers, phones and NAS.
