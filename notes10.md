## Notes 10: Automatic Scaling & Monitoring

### 1) Key Points Summarized
- AWS ELB - Elastic Load Balancing
- AWS CloudWatch
- AWS EC2 Auto Scaling

### 2) Two Quotes Identified
- "A network load balancer operates at the network transport level, or layer 4 of the OSI model" 
  1. I liked how this quote made a reference to the 7 OSI layers
- "A Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple EC2 instances"
  1. I've worked with classic load balancers, so know that they can be configured to work with EC2 instances was nice to hear




### 3) New Facts Learned were Described
It was interesting to see how AWS EC2 Auto Scaling will automatically create new EC2 instances when the demand for resources reaches the threashold configured.
