1) Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
The main components of Cloud Computing consist of 
- Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS), which administer the virtual hardware of your Virtual Machine (VM), such as how many CPUs, how much RAM and storage.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) which is where the components such as Operationg System, Database and Web Server are managed.
- Software as a Service (Saas) is the interface that users log in to use productivity applications.

2) Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
- When it comes to companies using cloud computing, AWS takes the lead.
I found this quote interesting, because it was mentioned in a lecture, that taking this class will prep us to be able to get an AWS certification.

- Google cloud platform is a universal cloud for Google's vast ecosystem and also for other products such as Microsoft Office it allows collaboration, storage of data and also other services offered by its cloud computing suite.
I found this quote interesting because I use GMail and Google Drive, so it is an environment I can relate to.

3) Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
There are many different cloud computing solutions, from companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google and IBM.  I think that the key is to concentrate on mastering one of these clouds, rather than trying to learn all of them.
