# Module 4 
## Cloud Economics, Billing & Support


### 1) Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.

#### AWS Cloud Computing Advantages 
- **Trade fixed expense for variable expense** – Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

- **Benefit from massive economies of scale** – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

- **Stop guessing capacity** – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

- **Increase speed and agility** – In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers** – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

- **Go global in minutes** – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

#### Terms to remember

- IAM - Access Management - You can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS
- S3 - Amazon's standare Storage
- TCO - Total Cost of Ownership - A formula that assess direct and inderect costs and benefits related to the purchase of any IT Component.
- VPC - Virtual Private Cloud


### 2) Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
##### "In the cloud world, companies and users can benefit from this scale because of a special thing called multitenancy." 
I liked how multitenancy was compared to an apartment building that shares resource.  I live in a condo, and we have to share the pool and split the bill for the maintenance, through the HOA fees.

##### "We just went past the 3 million man hour mark for zero lost-time incidents." 
The fact that Google has gone beyond 3 million man hours without incindents is very impressive and solidifies how reliable Google clouds is.
